## Training

We pair the training images with four different strategies, which are controlled by the hyper-parameter --training-set 1,2,3,4.
The fourth strategy generates the most training image pairs and is used as default.


## Submission

The validation_submission.py creates a subfolder [submission] in the current directory, which can be used for online evaluation.
